Why is the _ _name_ _ variable used?
-------------------------------------
- The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script.
- Sometimes you write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, you can import that script as a module in another
script.
- Examples refer programs 'FirstModule.py and SecondModule.py'

No method to find the lenth of the number:
------------------------------------------
If a num = 123, we can see its has 3 numbers 1,2 and 3 and its size is 3. But no method is available to find it.So we need to write custom code to
count the elements. Refer 'ArmstrongNumber.py' program for the function to count the elements of a number.

String formats
--------------
Three types of string formats and the examples can be found in 'String.py' file

Difference between list and tuple?
----------------------------------
List is mutable and the value of list can be changed.
Example:
lst  = [1,2,3]
lst[0] = 1.1
print(lst)
0/P:
[1.1, 2, 3]
Tuple is immutable and non of the tuple values can be changed
Example:
tup = (5,10,15)
tup[0] = 2.5
print(tup)
o/p:
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
